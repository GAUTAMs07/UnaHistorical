            <p>Chintapurni Mata Mandir is a Hindu place of worship. With loads of reverence and adoration, we went to perform puja there. Mata is here, for all of us. The temple can be reached via Una or via Dharamshala. You have to get a 'parchi' before you get an entry to the temple, and this building is approximately two kilometres away from the temple. Management should develop a better system for buying 'parchi' (tokens). It took us around one hour to get the parchi - and that too after a long wait in the queue and lots of push and shove!!
                Jai Maa Chintpurni</p></div>
